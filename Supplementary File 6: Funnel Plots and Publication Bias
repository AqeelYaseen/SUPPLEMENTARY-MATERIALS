                Hedges' g

Legend:
  ◆ = Pooled effect (g = 2.14)
  • = Individual studies
  Dashed lines = 95% CI funnel

Interpretation: Symmetric distribution around pooled effect.
No evidence of small-study effects or publication bias.
Egger's Regression Test Results
Model: Standard Error ~ Effect Size

Egger's Test for Funnel Plot Asymmetry

Intercept (β₀):    0.82
Standard Error:    0.63
t-value:           1.30
df:                25
P-value:           0.184

Conclusion: No significant small-study effects detected (P > 0.05).
Trim-and-Fill Analysis
Original Analysis (Random-Effects):
  Hedges' g = 2.14 [95% CI: 1.87, 2.41]
  N studies = 27

Trim-and-Fill Adjustment:
  Estimated missing studies (left side): 2
  Adjusted Hedges' g = 2.08 [95% CI: 1.82, 2.34]
  N studies (imputed) = 29

Change: -2.8% (minimal impact)

Conclusion: Publication bias unlikely to materially affect conclusions.
Doi Plot (Alternative to Funnel Plot)
LFK Index: 1.24

Interpretation:
  LFK < 1: No asymmetry
  LFK 1-2: Minor asymmetry
  LFK > 2: Major asymmetry

Result: Minor asymmetry detected, but within acceptable range.
